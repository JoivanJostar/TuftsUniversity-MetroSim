# Purpose

This program is the Project1 MetroSim Phase 1.

it contains 2 class : Passenger and PassengerQueue 



# Acknowledgements

the PassengerQueue is implemented by C++ STL < list >.

# FILES

Passenger.h  : the head file that defines the *Passenger* 's  basic structure.

Passenger.cpp  : implementations of  *Passenger*

PassengerQueue.h  : the head file that defines the *PassengerQueue*  class.

PassengerQueue.cpp  : implementations of  *PassengerQueue* 's interfaces based on C++ < list >

unit_tests.h : the unit test functions of  *Passenger* and *PassengerQueue*  it should be included in unit_test_driver.cpp.

unit_test_driver.cpp: a simple driver that calls all the unit_test functions in "unit_tests.h".

Makefile  :Used to make compilation and unit testing, creates an  execution of unit test called "unit_test".



# COMPILE &RUN

type "make" to use the makefile to build the project  and then run unit_test
# Test

The test code is in the unit_tests.h 

First I test the print() of Passenger to see if it works.

then I test  each of the functions implemented in *Passenger* and *PassengerQueue* in my own unit_test_driver, taking into account some edge cases. For example, call deque() or front()  from an empty list(this will throw an exception )
